    It is positioned on top of the page and always visible. This allows easy navigation if users wish to jump to a different section of the website. 
    * Navigation bar includes a brand logo and links to the four sections of the website: Home, Discover, Explore and Contact.
    * Navigation links are collapsed in small screen sizes into a hamburger menu and from medium size screens and larger, expand into a full size menu bar.
    * Brand logo serves as a Home page link, in addition to the Home link in the navbar. It is particularly convinient for users accessing the website on smaller screen devices to get 
    back to the Home page without having to use the hamburger menu.
    * All navigation links change color to dark grey (#4E4E4E) on hover.

* **Home**
    * A temporary Covid-19 alert banner has been added to the top of the Home Page, to help users to find out the latest information on the situation in Kyrgyzstan as 
    soon as they land on the website. "Latest travel advice" - serves as a link and takes users to GOV.UK website's Kyrgyzstan travel advice page, which opens up in a tew tab.
    The red background color has been chosen to highlight the importance of the section and to draw users' attention. 
    * Home page consists of a Bootstrap image carousel that cycles through a series of images showcasing the natural beauty of Kyrgyzstan.
    The image carousel allows 5 seconds delay between automatically cycling the images and includes previous / next controls for users' convenience. 

* **Discover**
    * This page consists of a heading, a text paragraph and Bootstrap 3 column cards section. 
    Heading - is an HTML h1 element, that also serves as a title for the whole website. It is followed by a text section and three column (on medium and larger screen sizes) Bootstrap cards section. 
    On small and extra-small screen sizes cards take up the whole width of the screen.
    * Each card consists of an image to visually support the content of the section and is followed by text. Images zoom out on hover for added user interactivity. 
    * On the bottom of the section there are "Read more" buttons which hide extra contents of the paragraphs and show the hidden content once user clicks on the button. 
    It allows to keep the page clean and neat. Once clicked, the buttons' inner text change to "Read Less", which user can click again to collapse the content. 

* **Explore**
    * Explore page consists of a heading, a sidebar and a map elements. The sidebar section contains a placeholder heading and a description text that appear when the page is loaded or refreshed.
    * The map section was designed using Google Maps API and focused on the map of Kyrgyzstan. It also contains markers to identify places of interest for users. 
    * Infowindow with the name of the location appears on mouseover on the markers and disappears on mouseout. This was desined to avoid clutter and increase visibility of the elements of the map. 
    If users click on a marker, a full information, including an image, name and description of the place appear in the sidebar section. 

* **Contact**
    * This page consists of a heading, paragraph and a contact form. The form includes fields: Name (required), 
    Email (required) and Message (optional), as well as a checkbox and a "Submit" button. All fields were carefully selected to make the form look simple to use and informal in order to 
    appeal to a wider pool of users. 
    "I would like to receive a newsletter" checkbox allows users to subscribe for a newsletter.
    * The form has been connected to EmailJS and allows users to send emails directly, using client-side technologies, without a need for a server. Upon clicking on the "Submit" button
    of the form, users will see a SweetAlert2 custom popup box to inform them if it has been successful / failed.

* **Footer**
    * Footer is designed using Bootstrap and is located on the bottom of the page. It is responsive and takes up the whole width of the screen on all screen size devices. 
    * The social media icons are placed in the middle of the bar and change color on hover (#a4a7a5) to let users know they are clickable. 
    Icons are linked to the external social media websites and open in new tabs.
    * Copyright info is placed underneath the social media icons.

## Further Testing
___
### Functionality Testing
___
* **Navigation Bar**
    * The fixed navbar is placed on top of the page and always visible on all screen sizes.
    * All the links on the navbar have been clicked to test and are working as intended, allowing users to jump to the linked page.
    * Brand logo is linked to the Home page and is working as expected.
    * The navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on screen sizes smaller than 768px. A navigation menu appears 
    when you click on the hamburger icon. This has been tested and working as intended.

* **Image Carousel**
    * Bootstrap Image carousel takes up the full page as intended and cycles through the images. The time delay attribute is functioning 
    as intended, allowing 5 seconds delay between automatically cycling the images.
    * Carousel-fade animation is working properly and allows a fade transition instead of a slide.
    * Previous and Next controls have been clicked to test and are working as expected, taking users to the previous / next slide.

* **Cards Section**
    * Cards section images have been tested by hovering over them and zoom-out as expected. 
    * All three Read more / Read less buttons change color on hover and display more / less text when clicked. The inner texts of the buttons change when clicked as expected too.
    During the development process, clicking on "Read more" button resulted in only the first button working correctly. This has been rectified by following an recommendation from a 
    thread in Stack Overflow (see Code Credits) - the `display` properties have been removed so the classes can be added / removed in JavaScript to change the inner texts of the buttons.
    * Cards section is responsive and works as designed, each taking the 100% width of the screen on smaller screen sizes.

* **Map Section**
    * All Google Map markers have been for testing purposes and are functioning correctly. Upon clicking on the markers, the corresponding info window content 
    appears in the sidebar section, located to the left of the map on medium and larger screens and on top of the map on small screen sizes.
    * This section proved to be very challenging to get it work correctly and required an extensive online research. I have also had help from my mentor during our live 
    project review session to debug and ensure the image and description of the places display in the "sidebar" div when the markers are clicked. 
    * On hover, info windows do not display "x" closing button as it has been intentionally removed for a cleaner look.

* **Contact Form**
    * The Contact form has been tested by submitting the form with one or more empty required fields. This returns an error message requesting to fill in all the requested fields.
    * When a text input entered into an email field it returns an error "@ sign should be included in the email address". This however doesn't stop users from 
    entering incorrect email address.
    * "Submit" button changes color on hover as intended.
    * JavaScript `reset()` function is working correctly as the form resets after users fill in all input fields with valid data and click on "Submit" 
    button.
    * Tests revealed that the page was scrolling up to the top each time the form had been submitted. To prevent this from happening, `return false;` had been added to the event handler.
    * When the form has been submitted, users see a customised SweetAlert2 message to confirm their action has been successful / failed. This has been tested and 
    is working as expected.
    * The Contact Form has been correctly linked to EmailJS and sends an email every time users submit the form.

* **Footer**
    * Footer is responsive and always stays on the bottom of the page. This have been tested by reducing / increasing the screen width and is working as intended.
    * Change of colour and transition effects on hovering over Social Icons have been tested and working as intended.
    * Click on each Social icon revealed that links are functioning as intended and open in new tabs.

### Performance Testing
___
Performance testing was carried out using Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools. 
It has shown excellent performance and accessibility results for desktop devices.
* For mobile devices the following steps have been taken to improve the performance:
    * Newer version of the Bootstrap was installed as the older version had security vulnerabilities according to the Lighthouse.
    * Images were resized and compressed multiple times to improve the loading speed of the website.
